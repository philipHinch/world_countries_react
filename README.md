# World Countries React

This app will display all the information of all the countries in the world. You can sort them by name, population, area and capital. Clicking on the country will display extra information.

This is a remake of my vanilla javascript world-countries app I did a while ago.

## Technologies used:

- react hooks
- usecontext and usereducer
- high order functions
- fetch api
- asynchronus programming
- css animations

## What I've learnt:

- Do not modify original data. I found out that filtering the original data and then saving it back to context was not a good idea.
